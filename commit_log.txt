- Commit 2 (PyTorch Decoder): Train a lightweight PyTorch neural decoder model on the time-series data to predict actionable outputs (actuations).
- Commit 3 (C++ Translation): Export the PyTorch model and write the C++ inference scripts to load and execute the model parameters natively.
- Commit 4 (Latency Optimization): Optimize the C++ data loading and inference bridge to guarantee end-to-end processing speeds of <15ms.
